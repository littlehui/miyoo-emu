<p><span class="rvts16">What is Tool Assisted Speedrunning?</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>A tool-assisted speedrun (commonly abbreviated TAS) is a speedrun movie or performance produced with the use of tools such as slow motion and re-recording. The basic premise of these runs is that a "tool" (such as an emulator that provides the author with features that are unavailable in regular playing) is used in order to overcome human limitations such as skill and reflex.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Creating a tool-assisted speed run is the process of finding the ideal set of inputs to complete a given criterion - usually completing a game as fast as possible. No limits are imposed on the tools used for this search, but the result has to be a set of timed key-presses that, when played back on the actual console, achieves the target criterion. Traditionally, the only available tool for this was an emulator with re-recording - the ability to use savestate while recording key-presses. However, due to advances in the field, it is now often expected that frame-advance, stepping through emulation one frame at a time, is used. A tool-assisted speed run done without this technique may be criticised as "sloppy play". Before Frame Advance became common, playing in slow motion was a common technique, but Frame Advance has displaced this.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In essence, Tool Assistance allows one to overcome human limitations of skill and reflex in order to push a game to its limits. &nbsp;One important thing to remember is that TAS movies are not competing in terms of playing skill, nor do they claim to. </p>

<p><span class="rvts16">Movie making</span></p>
<p><span class="rvts16"><br/></span></p>
<p>To get started making a Tool Assisted Movie, simply begin recording a movie (see <a class="rvts18" href="MovieRecording.html">Movie Recording</a>). &nbsp;The basic premise of TASing, however, is to use re-records to optimize the execution of a decided upon goal (usually to complete the game as fast as possible). &nbsp;Re-recording is the act of replacing an already recorded part (of a movie) with something else; also called undo.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In the making of emulator movies, re-recording is done by loading a savestate of earlier event in the movie and continuing playing from that point. &nbsp;The emulator will update the movie file to undo everything that was cancelled by the savestate loading, and continue recording from that point. &nbsp;The makers of tool-assisted speedruns use re-recording very extensively to reach perfection and to avoid mistakes.</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* In single-segment non-assisted speedruns, re-recording is starting over from beginning. The recording of the failed playing is usually not preserved. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* In multi-segment non-assisted speedruns, re-recording is starting over from the beginning of current segment. The recording of the failed segment is not preserved. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* In tool-assisted speedruns, re-recording only undoes a small part of playing. The undone part will not be seen in the resulting movie. &nbsp;A tool-assisted movie may have been re-recorded anything between 50 and 200000 times, depending on the precision of the movie and the difficulty of the game. &nbsp;Often, the same small passage of the game (could be as small as fractions of second long) is attempted tens of times before continuing. </p>
