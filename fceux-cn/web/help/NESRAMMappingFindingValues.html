<p>This guide gives a map of the addresses in the NES cpu and explains each portion in detail. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It also provides information for the basic layout of ram values in typical NES games. &nbsp;This info can be used to quickly map and find useful values in the game's ram.</p>

<p>2A03 CPU memory map</p>
<p>2A03 CPU is a 6502-compatible CPU without the decimal mode (CLD and SED do nothing). It has an on-die sound generator, very limited DMA capability, and an input device controller that can be accessed through the 2A03 registers.</p>

<p>The NES PPU has enough RAM for two nametables (0 and 3); it brings some PPU nametable address lines to the cart edge so that the cart can decide whether to map 0 onto 2 and 1 onto 3 (vertical mirroring as in Super Mario Brothers and Contra) or 0 onto 1 and 2 onto 3 (horizontal mirroring as in Kid Icarus and Ikari), all screens to either 0 or 3 (as in many Rare games such as Battletoads and Jeopardy!), or all screens to RAM on the cartridge (as in Gauntlet). Split-screen games that scroll in all four directions (such as Super Mario Brothers 3 and Kirby's Adventure) often use vertical or one-screen mirroring (with a small amount of screen corruption at the sides due to tiles wrapping around the sides) and stick the status bar in some random unused area of the screen. </p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mapping RAM/Finding Ram</p>

<p>This guide is written specifically for finding useful values for TAS <a class="rvts18" href="MovieRecording.html">movie making</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It does not tell you how to use specific tools to find values. &nbsp;For that refer to <a class="rvts18" href="HexEditor.html">Hex editor</a>, <a class="rvts18" href="CheatSearch.html">Cheat Search</a>, and <span class="rvts18">RAM filter</span>.</p>

<p>Most games use the basic on board ram. &nbsp;The address range of this ram is $0000-$07FF. &nbsp;This translates to 2048 possible ram values.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span class="rvts41">Pages</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This ram is broken down into 8 pages. &nbsp;A "page" is a block of 256 ram values.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I will refer to these values as such:</p>
<p>Block 0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$00xx &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;($0000-$00FF)</p>
<p>Block 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$01xx &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;($0100-$01FF)</p>
<p>Block 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$02xx &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;($0200-$02FF)</p>
<p>Block 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$03xx &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;($0300-$03FF)</p>
<p>Block 4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$04xx &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;($0400-$04FF)</p>
<p>Block 5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$05xx &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;($0500-$05FF)</p>
<p>Block 6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$06xx &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;($0600-$06FF)</p>
<p>Block 7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$07xx &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;($0700-$07FF)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Each block will be organized will similar data. &nbsp;For instance, all sprite data will be in the same block. &nbsp;Enemy/Player statistics (energy, coordinates, speed, etc.) will be in another. &nbsp;For instance, if you find the main character's HP and it is located in block 3, you know that the remaining stats for the character are also in that block. &nbsp;This can significantly cut down time when trying to find related values.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>There are always the following blocks:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span class="rvts32">Sprite Data</span><span class="rvts32"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="rvts32"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>Block 2</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I've yet to see map a game that does not use this block solely for sprite data. &nbsp;It will contain the "ID" numbers for all the items currently on the screen. &nbsp;Simply put, this data is precisely the data you see on the screen. &nbsp;For making TAS movies this is not useful data. &nbsp;If you are using cheat search and have narrowed it down your search to a few values, you can immediately discard any $02xx values.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In games with a lot of sprite data, I've seen blocks 1 &amp; 3 also reserved for sprite data.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span class="rvts32">Music &amp; Sound FX</span><span class="rvts32"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>Block 1 or 7, generally</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This one has more deviation, but almost all games reserve an entire block for memory allocated to the game's Music and Sound FX. &nbsp;Again, for TAS purposes these values are not *useful. By finding even 1 of these values, you can eliminate that block from your search possibilities. &nbsp; Finding which block is reserved for music is often quite simple with the <a class="rvts18" href="HexEditor.html">Hex editor</a>. &nbsp;Watching the ram values with the game playing, you can see which addresses "move to the beat". &nbsp;</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>*Actually they can come in handy for "dancing to the beat"</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span class="rvts32">Player &amp; Enemy Stats</span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Blocks 1,3,4,5 generally (any or all of these)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This is your "sweet spot" for movie making, as often you will be wanting to track the players speed or coordinates, enemy energy, or enemy coordinates.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>These values rarely (if at all) reside outside blocks 1, 3, 4, or 5. &nbsp;This knowledge already reduces your search possibilities in half!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span class="rvts41">Rows </span></p>
<p><span class="rvts41"><br/></span></p>
<p>Each block is broken down into 16 "rows" of addresses. &nbsp;For example, in block 3, the first row is $030x ($0300-$030F).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Each row of 16* will contain similar data. &nbsp;For instance all x coordinates will generally be in the same row. &nbsp;So xxx0 might be the main characters x position. &nbsp;xxxx1 would be "enemy 1" (1st enemy loaded onto the screen), and so on.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The y coordinates would be in another row, x subpixel values in yet another row, etc.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>*Super Mario Bros. 2 (U) is a rare example that uses rows of 10</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span class="rvts41">Columns</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>A column would be all the values of a block that share the same last digit. &nbsp;So a column would be 16 addresses such as $0300, $0310, $0320, etc.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For enemy/player stats, columns usually refer to the same player or enemy.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So for example, if a player's energy was stored in $0300. &nbsp;The remaining row will be other player/enemy's energy. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If the next row ($031x) is x positions. &nbsp;$0310 would be the player's x position. &nbsp;The remaining positions of that row would correspond to the other player/enemy x positions in line with the hp values of the previous row.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span class="rvts41">Example</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>These distinctions are easier to see in a visual example. &nbsp;This is the enemy/player stats as they are mapped in the game <span class="rvts29">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</span>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span class="rvts32">Block 4</span></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>P = current turtle (player)</p>
<p>W = weapon (up to 3 on the screen at one time)</p>
<p>E = enemy (up to 8 on the screen at one time)</p>
<p>X = no use</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>E1 = "Enemy slot 1" which will be the first enemy on the screen loaded into memory. &nbsp;The 2nd will be placed in "Enemy slot 2". &nbsp;When enemy 1 is removed from memory (killed or goes off screen), the next enemy will be loaded into that slot. &nbsp;Enemy's always take the lowest available slot when loaded. &nbsp;Note: usually enemy slots are in reverse order. &nbsp;So the first addresses is usually the last enemy slot loaded into memory. &nbsp;TMNT is an exception.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>All object (player, weapon, enemy) characteristics reside in block 4.</p>
<p>Each row is a different characteristic of each object on the screen (040x refers to a sprite ID of an object)</p>
<p>Each column corresponds to a specific object on the screen. &nbsp;(All 04x0 's refer to the player).</p>
