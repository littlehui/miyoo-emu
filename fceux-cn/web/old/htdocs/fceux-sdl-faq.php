 <a name="intro"><h2>What's the difference between the windows and sdl ports?</h2></a>
 <p>A lot of work that has been done on the FCE code base was been windows only, so 
 some features have not been implemented into the more portable SDL version. </p>
 <p>Here is a list of planned features that are currently in the Win32 build 
 but are missing from the SDL build:</p>
 <ul>
   <li />Autosaving
   <li />Hotkey mapping
   <li />More graphical ways of configuring FCEUX
 </ul>
 <p>I'm going to reiterate that much of the work that has been done of the FCEUX 
 code base has been windows only, so some features will probably never be ported 
 to the SDL version.  If you are a casual user that just wants to play old NES games, the SDL 
 build will be sufficient for you.  However, if you want to use the extensive
 TAS and debugging features that FCEUX has to offer, you are better of using
 the windows build in <a href=http://winehq.org>wine</a>.  Here is a list of features
 that will most likely never be ported to the SDL port.</p>
 <ul>
   <li />Memory watch
   <li />Ram filter
   <li />TAS edit
   <li />Most of the debugging features
 </ul>
 <a name="config"><h3>How do I configure a gamepad?</h3></a>
 <p>
  You can configure the first gamepad by running <b>fceux --inputcfg gamepad1</b> </p>
  <p>When you do this, you'll be presented with a black window with a titlebar
  indicating what button to map.  FCEUX will look for two
  of the same keypress/joystick event in a row.  If it doesn't find two of the same 
  keypresses in a row, it will allow you to map the button to four seperate keys.</p>
  <p>Input configuration is planned for gfceux.</p>
 </p>
 <a name="lua"><h4>Why do I need lua5.1 to compile/run fceux?</h4></a>
 <p>You don't! As of version 2.0.3, lua is optional.  However, the lua scritping 
 engine in fceux is very powerful, and will be used more and more by fceux in the future.</p>
