windows:

enh: new toggles: frame adv, lag skip (menu item + hotkey mapping + saved in config)
enh: added a mute turbo option in sound config
enh: add an option to pick a constant color to draw in place of BG when BG rendering is disabled (look for gNoBGFillColor in config; 255 means to use palette[0])
enh: added shift+L as default hotkey for reload lua script
enh: SF [ 2040463 ] Add an "author" text field in the record movie dialog
enh: SF [ 2047004 ] Moviefilenames without extension don't automatically get fm2 (and they need to)
enh: print a special message when trying to open an FCM reminding user to convert

sdl:
bug: all commandline options now use --argument as they always should have.
bug: fix issue which was resetting config file
bug: Saner sound defaults for less choppy sound
bug: Fixed a bug that would crash fceux if the emulation speed was overincreased
bug: fixed --input(1-4) options
bug: build scripts now look for lua5.1 and lua (distributions package lua differently)
