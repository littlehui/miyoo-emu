Version
-------

FBA SDL is based on FBA 0.2.96.86 and is intended for both Dingux/OpenDingux.
It can be run on Dingoo a320, Dingoo a380 and Ritmix rzx50. Screen size is
detected automatically.

Romset is synchronized with MAME 0.126


How to use FB Alpha
-------------------

FBA SDL is now merged with the frontend based on Capex in one application. Just
run it, press START and choose Rom Show mode: all, available or non-available.
If needed, supplementary rom paths could be set.

FBA SDL could be used as a standalone application when invoked with
rom zip with full path as a parameter:

./fbasdl.dge ./roms/dino.zip

Full path and extension are obligatory.


Commandline interface
---------------------

FBA SDL can also be invoked with command line options.
The options are as follows;

./fbasdl.dge <game> [<parameters>]

<game>                  - The game's romname with full path and extension.
--sound-sdl             - Use SDL for sound
--sound-sdl-old         - Use SDL for sound (old mutex sync)
--sound-ao              - Use libao for sound (OpenDingux only)
--no-sound              - Just be silent
--samplerate=<Hz>       - Valid values are: 11025, 22050 and 44100
--showfps               - Show frames per second while play
--68kcore=<value>       - Choose Motorola 68000 emulation core.
                          0 - C68k, 1 - Musashi M68k, 2 - A68k
--z80core=<value>       - Choose Z80 emulation core.
                          0 - cz80, 1 - mame_z80
--vsync                 - Use vertical sync for video

Example:

./fbasdl.dge ./roms/dino.zip --sound-sdl --samplerate=44100 --68kcore=0 --z80core=0


Controls and hotkeys
--------------------

Standard keymapping:
D-PAD        - D-PAD
SELECT       - Coin1
START        - Start1
SELECT+START - Start2
A            - Fire1
B            - Fire2
X            - Fire3
Y            - Fire4
L            - Fire5
R            - Fire6

L+R+Y        - Show/hide fps
L+R+A        - Quick state load
L+R+B        - Quick state save
L+R+SELECT   - Service menu
L+R+START    - FBA menu (key config and load/save states)

All fire keys could be redefined in the menu.


Usage/optimisation tips
-----------------------

If you are running on OpenDingux on Dingoo a320 you should do the following:

 - Overclock fbasdl to 408MHz (link properties)
 - Enable swap support:
   Create or edit the config file local/etc/swap.conf and add a line containing
   SWAP_SD_SIZE_MB=megabytes. The path can be changed by adding a line
   containing SWAP_SD_FILE=path.

If you are running on legacy Dingux on Dingoo a320/a380 or Ritmix rzx50
you can use the following bash script to enable swap

<<<< - cut here
    #! /bin/sh

    if [ ! -e ./fba.swp ]; then
        dd if=/dev/zero of=./.fba/fba.swp bs=2048 count=65536
    fi

    mkswap ./fba.swp
    swapon ./fba.swp

    # start actual emulator
    ./fbasdl.dge "$1" --sound-sdl --samplerate=22050

    swapoff ./fba.swp
<<<< - cut here

Slaanesh for not releasing FBA320 sources which gave me enough motivation to
replicate his work. :)
